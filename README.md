🌤️ Power BI Weather & AQI Dashboard

🌟 Project Overview

  * 📊 Built an interactive Weather & Air Quality Dashboard in Power BI Desktop.

  * 🏙️ Focused on multiple Indian cities (Ajmer, Jamshedpur, Noida, Raipur, etc.) with city‑wise data files.

  * 🌦️ Visualizes current conditions, 7‑day forecast, hourly forecast, AQI metrics, and rain chances in a single view.

  * 🎨 Designed with a dark, modern UI to make insights easy to read and presentation‑ready.



📁 Files included in this repo

  * 🧩 Weather_Dashboard.pbix – main Power BI report file.

  * 📙 CURRENT_DATA.xlsx – current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, visibility, pressure, UV index, precipitation).

  * 📘 FORECAST_BY_DAY_DATA.xlsx – 7‑day forecast data used for the line chart and chances‑of‑rain visuals.

  * 📗 FORCAST_BY_HOUR_DATA.xlsx – hourly forecast data for detailed time‑based analysis.

  * 📒 LOCATION_DATA.xlsx – list of cities/locations used in the dashboard.

  * 📕 MASTER_DATA.xlsx – combined master dataset for weather and AQI metrics.

  * 🧾 DATA_OF_AJMER.xlsx, DATA_OF_JAMSHEDPUR.xlsx, DATA_OF_NOIDA.xlsx, DATA_OF_RAIPUR.xlsx – city‑wise detailed datasets.

  * 🖼️ Screenshot-*.jpg – high‑resolution screenshots of the final dashboard.



🔎 Key dashboard features

  * 🌡️ Current Weather Card – city, temperature, weather status, and last updated time.

  * 💨 KPI tiles – humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, UV index, and precipitation.

  * 📈 7‑Day Forecast chart – temperature trend across the week.

  * 🌅 Sunrise & Sunset panel – daily sunrise and sunset times.

  * 💚 Air Quality Index section – donut gauge plus pollutant metrics (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, O3) with status label.

  * 🌧️ Chances of Rain – bar/stack visuals showing probability of rain for each day.

  * 🎨 Conditional formatting & custom colors – color‑coded AQI levels and weather indicators.



🛠️ Tools & technologies

  * 🧮 Power BI Desktop – data modelling, DAX measures, and visualization.

  * 📊 Microsoft Excel – data preparation and storage of all input datasets.

  * 🧠 DAX measures – for KPIs like current temperature, wind speed, AQI suggestion, and pollutant color logic.
